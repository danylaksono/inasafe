The files in this folder were autogenerated from the inasafe-doc repo,
do NOT EDIT HERE!!!

These docs are shipped so that someone checking out the plugin from git will
have working docs, and also so that tests will work. When we create the
release build, we will build the user-docs from the inasafe-doc repo into the
release package.

See scripts/release.sh for more info on how we do this.

==========
Using QGIS
==========

|project_name| uses `Quantum GIS (QGIS) <http://qgis.org>`_ - as the platform on 
which to provide its functionality. QGIS itself has good documentation and 
a very helpful user community. In this section we focus on those aspects of
QGIS functionality that will be helpful to someone wanting to carry out
impact scenario assessments using |project_name|.

There are three good resources to get you up to speed with using GIS in
general and QGIS in particular:

* The `Gentle Introduction to GIS <http://linfiniti.com/dla>`_ by Linfiniti
  Consulting - it is a free electronic book that introduces the concepts of GIS
  in a very easy to read manner.
* The `QGIS User Manual <http://qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html>`_ - 
  also an electronic book that serves as a reference guide to the QGIS Desktop
  Application.
* The `QGIS Training Manual <http://manual.linfiniti.com>`_ by Linfiniti
  Consulting that provides a detailed training guide on QGIS and PostGIS.


Things to cover (suggested by Trias Aditya)

- access to statistics data
- access to WFS (for exposure data)
- access to WMS (for background data)
- you have got an idea to access WCS (e.g. hazard, elevation data etc)
- map the projected impact into graphical charts (this will be my
  favourites then...)

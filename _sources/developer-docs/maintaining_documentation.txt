Maintaining the documentation
=============================

The documentation for |project_name| is written using ReSTructured text (.rst)
and the Sphinx documenation builder. The best way to learn how to write .rst
is to look at the source of existing documentation - the markup syntax is
very simple. There are a number of useful tags that you can use to make
your documentation clear and visually interesting, the more commonly used in
this document are listed below. For a more detailed list, please visit
the `Spinx Inline Markup page <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/inline.html>`_

A complete list of supported .rst markup is also available
`here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#block-quotes>`_.

   .. todo:: Todo item in a call out box

.. _api-documentation-howto-label:

Creating API Documentation
--------------------------

Each class method and function in the code base must include a docstring
explaining its usage and purpose as per the example listed below (taken from
the riab.py setupI18n method)::

        """Setup internationalisation for the plugin.

        See if QGIS wants to override the system locale
        and then see if we can get a valid translation file
        for whatever locale is effectively being used.

        Args:
           thePreferredLocale - optional parameter which if set
               will override any other way of determining locale.
        Returns:
           None.
        Raises:
           no exceptions explicitly raised.
        """

There should be a blank line between each paragraph and before the Args option.

Where multiple inputs or outputs are used, a ReSTructured text bullet list
should be used to list them.

.. note:: You can use any ReSTructured text withing the docstring to deliver
   rich markup in the final API documentation outputs.

In order for a new module's documentation to appear in the API docs, the
following steps are required:

* Create a new file in :file:`docs/source/api-docs/<package_name>`
  named after the module. For example, for the gui/riab.py module we would
  create :file:`docs/source/api-docs/gui/riab.rst` (note the .rst extension).
  See below for an example of its contents
* Add the new file to the API docs master index
  (:file:`docs/source/api-docs/index.rst`).
  The .rst extension is not needed or desired when adding to the index list.
* Regenerate the documentation using the :command:`make docs` command from
  the top level directory in the source tree.
* Add the new .rst file and generated html files to the revision control system.

.. note:: It is probably most expedient to simply copy and rename one of the
   existing API documentation files and replace the python module paths therein.

An example of the contents of a module's API .rst if provided below::

    Module:  safe.common.polygon
    ============================

    .. automodule:: safe.common.polygon
          :members:

This module forms part of the `InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org>`_ tool.

A couple of things should be noted here:

* Sphinx provides automodule and autoclass directives. We have opted to use
  **automodule** for all API documentation because autoclass requires that
  each class be enumerated and anonymous functions need to be explicitly listed.
* Automodule must point to a fully qualified python module path.
* The **members** directive instructs autodocs to enumerate all classes and
  functions in that module.


Once the new document has been added and the documentation generated, you
should see it appear in the API section of the |project_name| documentation.


.. _documenting-new-features-howto-label:

Documenting new features
------------------------

New features should be well documented and that documentation should be made
available uder the :file:`user-docs` subfolder of the sphinx sources tree.

For example, when the keywords editor dialog feature was introduced, we created
a new sphinx document :file:`docs/sources/user-docs/keywords.rst` which
documents this new feature. Additionally, the help button is set to launch
the help dialog in the context of the new help document e.g.::

   def showHelp(self):
      """Load the help text for the keywords gui"""
      if not self.helpDialog:
         self.helpDialog = RiabHelp(self.iface.mainWindow(), 'keywords')
      self.helpDialog.show()

Where the 'keywords' parameter indicates the user-docs/\*.rst document that
should be opened when the help button is clicked. The general style and
approach used in existing documentation should inform your documentation
process so that all the documentation is constent.

Publishing the documentation to GitHub Pages
--------------------------------------------

Initially we have used http://readthedocs.org to host our site (and the pages
you are reading now). However they don't support internationalisation and
there are various other issues with it, so we opted to move our content into
gh-pages. To use this, the site is stored in a special branch.

Initial gh-pages setup
......................

Enable gh-pages in th gh project
`admin page <https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/admin>`_. On your local system
do something like this::

   git clone file:///home/timlinux/dev/python/inasafe-dev \
       inasafe-github-pages
   cd inasafe-github-pages
   cp ../inasafe-dev/.git/config .git/config
   git pull
   git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
   rm .git/index
   git clean -fdx
   cp -r ../inasafe-dev/docs/build/html .
   cd html/
   touch .nojekyll
   git add .
   git commit -a -m "First commit of docs"
   git push origin gh-pages

Now wait ten minutes or so and the pages should be visble here at
http://aifdr.github.com/inasafe/

Updating the site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deployment of the site requires the following steps:

* Regenerate the docs using make docs in the root dir of a master branch
  checkout of InaSAFE.
* Copy all files from :file:`docs/build/html` into a separate local repo
  checked out in the gh-pages branch
* Commit those changes and push
* Wait approximately 10 minutes

After this the changes should be visible here http://aifdr.github.com/inasafe/
